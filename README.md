# Transfer Learning Neural Network
Project of a transfer learning neural network using MobileNetV2 architecture

Steps for performing codes:

1. Install venv with `python -m venv python-venv`
2. Create Virtual Enviroment with `source ./python-venv/bin/activate`
2. In case it's Windows, use `./python-venv/Scripts/activate`
3. Install required packages with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Execute code with `python [filename.py]`
